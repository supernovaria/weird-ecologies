# Part 2: Cyborgs and Hybridity
Donna Haraway’s concept of the cyborg as a boundary-crossing figure – a hybrid of machine and organism, nature and culture – provides a useful foundation and combined with the class discussions, this sparked extensive thoughts. I propose a rough classification of cyborgs based on motivation. These could either be of "regular" technological or biotech nature:
1. **Medical Cyborgs**: Augmentations for survival or restoration (e.g., pacemakers).
2. **Self-Expressive Cyborgs**: Modifications for aesthetic or identity reasons (e.g., (glowing) tattoos, tails).
3. **Performance-Oriented Cyborgs**: Enhancements that grant superhuman capabilities (e.g., vision beyond the "visible spectrum", extreme strength, or cognitive augmentations).

These categories can roughly divide the types of augmentations, but individuals might of course want to have several kinds of augmentations or want them for several reasons. This list might very well not be exhaustive, but they were what I was able to come up with. 

## **Trans**formative Medicine: Mind over Body
#### 1) Medical Cyborgs & 2) Self-Expressive Cyborgs

The first two categories as well as the _Mind over Body_ idea appear particularly trans-themed: to literally transcend the limitations and transform the body into how it was supposed to be all along.
There’s also a significant overlap with transhumanist philosophy, which sees body modification as one path to freedom or fulfilment. 


>[!quote] Excerpt from Crystal Society, Chapter 8
>Instead of legs the avatar had a serpentine body and tail, like some sort of mythical creature coated in gold. […] <br>
>"To paraphrase The Third Principle: Birthform is not trueshape. […] Only when we rebuild into who we want to be, can we know what it is to be truly free."



One of the more uncomfortable insights was that not all desires are inherently good. Specifically, from a _transhumanist_ perspective, we must also question where those desires originate from. Are they shaped by oppressive social systems, evolutionarily maladaptive instincts, or external pressures like capitalism, war, specific (patriarchal) societal standards? This complicates the narrative that self-transformation is always emancipatory. It demands careful discernment: not rejecting change, but questioning what drives it. <br>
_The Stone Gods_ shows quite well how societal and capitalistic pressures that might emerge if alterations become not just normal but the default.

>[!quote] Excerpts from The Stone Gods
> 'So, sexy sex is now about freaks and children. If you want to work in the sex industry, you get yourself cosmetically altered in shape and size. […] Grotesques earn good money. […]'
>
> 'It doesn't make sense to me. We have a society where routine cosmetic surgery and genetic Fixing are considered normal—'

On the other hand, if society _insists_ on the opposite – keeping and treasuring the "god given bodies" – then anyone who is not born in a body they can feel comfortable in will become stigmatized.

The pushback against and marginalization of the hybrid people and their self-expression can be seen as an allegory of *t***r**a**n***s* <span style="color: color-mix(in srgb, var(--darkgray) 65%, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0))">(and other members of the LGBTQ and GSRM)</span> communities.

    2064: Read Only Memories talking to Brian at the Human Revolution protest in front of genus
  </div>
</div>

When talking to an organizer of a Human Revolution protest in front of a centre where people can get genetic modifications, Brian offers reasonable sounding concerns for society and even the people seeking out the services of **genus**, but all as a guise that is very reminiscent of our world and the rhetoric around children and teenagers being "made gay" or "made trans" and that anything they do not find normal, did not grow up with, is against god's will.

> "It's playing God on the highest order, and threatens to unseat what humanity is altogether." – Brian, 2064: Read Only Memories

While questioning the motives of big corporations is laudable, when Brian says _"we must take a stand against the medical research industry that would have us cast aside our humanity for their 'miracles'"_ it reminds very much of the incorrect argument that big pharmaceutical companies are getting rich off of the (in reality out-of-pocket quite affordable and in total small numbers of) estrogen and testosterone gels, pills, patches, etc. given to trans people, rather than focusing on the real and much larger issues in medicine, pharmaceutics, and public health.
In the beginning of the clip Brian also suggests that people get genetic modifications (**Hormone Replacement Therapy**) done on a whim and that the Human Revolution only wants pre-genetic-modification (**pre-transition**) people to give this a bit of thought before going through with this.

## Competition: Machine over Mind
#### 3) Performance-Oriented Cyborgs
What happens when cyborgism becomes not just possible but advantageous? The divide between augmented and unaugmented humans would no longer be purely cultural, as in categories 1 and 2, but biological or technological _superiority_. Once those that are willing to augment their bodies and minds not out of medical necessity or for self-expressive purposes, but for gaining an edge, profit, and crushing the competition are able to do so, a new race-dynamic is going to start.
Those unwilling to modify their bodies – for moral, religious, or personal reasons – might find themselves economically disadvantaged, politically marginalized, or militarily outclassed for a while, until their resistance to change turns existential: change or lose.

This scenario has clear real-world analogues: it mirrors the dynamics of colonialism, class struggle, and technological imperialism, but also the many dynamics in any hyper-competitive, capitalistic system.

And as discussed earlier, the danger is not just inequality, but conflict: even more so if some people do not just look different, but have vastly improved capabilities. One side might see the other as regressive, while the other sees augmentation as a betrayal of human essence and likely dangerous. Particularly with this, the chance of strong class divides seem likely. I could see them going in two directions: between those able to afford it and those that do not (if they are very expensive); or those wealthy enough to not need certain kinds of augmentations as they have no need to work, and those that require them to afford their livelihood (if they are affordable enough that lower and middle class people are able to afford them).

##### Some examples from fiction:
In Tchaikovsky’s _Children of Time_ human civilization collapses due to a conflict between pro- and anti-technology factions. The anti-tech side releases a digital virus that destroys technology and with it kills all non-Earth habitats. Their justification is deeply ideological: biotech enhancements and AI development are a kind of heresy by playing god. They acted radically and desperatly to avoid a future they deemed monstrous and worse than no future at all.

On the other hand, in _Three Bodies at Mitanni_ by Seth Dickinson, an offshoot of humanity on a far off planet has modified itself so much for the sake of progress, advancement, and – above all – productivity, that they became a quasi non-conscious planet-spanning collective, where every individual willfully undergoes as much pain as is necessary to further their civilisation even by the tiniest amounts. The modified species has lost art, emotion, and individuality, in order to maximize its civilizational output.
Earth emissaries must decide whether or not to classify this as a "Duong-Watts malignancy", requiring annihilation to prevent unconscious super-spreaders from taking over the galaxy, before it is too late for conscious life.

Lastly, in Yudkowsky’s _Three Worlds Collide_ humanity meets two other alien species, the Super Happy People and the Baby Eating People, that are so fundamentally different from humanity and its common values, that the humans onboard their ship – as well as the reader – are tasked with deciding whether to change humanity forever and integrate the other species' strange values into our own set of morals, in exchange for them integrating and satisfying human values; or to start a suicide mission that destroys the star system around which these three species found themselves and destroy all chances of connection between humanity and the other two species.

## Conclusion 
While the lines between the first two categories (medical necessity and self-expression) of cyborg augmentations and the last one (peformance-oriented enhancements) might in reality be blurry, it seems important to me to allow the first two kinds for greater human flourishing and self-expression (whilst being careful about strong cultural divides to avoid violence and conflict) and prudent to slow or halt progress on the third kind to avoid race dynamics or oppression by superpowered humans. Perhaps akin to Toby Ord's idea of the "Long Reflection", during which humanity can "reflect upon what we truly desire; upon which of these visions for humanity would be the best realization of our potential" (_[The Precipice](https://theprecipice.com/author)_ by Toby Ord). <br>
Humanity has made enormous progress within the past two centuries <span style="font-size: 0.93em; opacity: 0.7">(e.g. see [GDP per capita over the long run – OWiD ](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/global-average-gdp-per-capita-over-the-long-run), [Life expectancy increased in all countries of the world – OWiD ](https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy-increased-in-all-countries-of-the-world))</span>, however, progress in ethics, wisdom, and good governance – while existent – are much less consistent and there is much more to be desired, given how much our impact on the world and its inhabitants have increased <span style="font-size: 0.93em; opacity: 0.7">(e.g. see [Plastic Pollution - OWiD ](https://ourworldindata.org/plastic-pollution), [Global Warming by Gas and Source – OWiD ](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/global-warming-by-gas-and-source), but at least [SDG Tracker: Measuring progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals – OWiD ](https://ourworldindata.org/sdgs))</span>. Respectively, I find that fostering better, more inclusive institutions, moral and ethical progress of society and reaching a more equal world should be (or rather should already have been) prerequisites for technological advancements and increases in power and influence of humans over others and the environment.
