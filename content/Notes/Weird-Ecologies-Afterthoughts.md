# Afterthoughts
#### Historical Parallels and Ethical Stakes
Having already read a lot of science fiction, it always presented itself to me as a warning about the future or _a_ future. The readings for and discussions during this class, as well as the thoughts going into this essay helped me see how it also reflects existing injustices. 
Working through these stories with these new perspectives has helped me notice patterns and metaphors I would have previously overlooked. Writing this essay has helped me connect the **speculative** to the _real_ and to the _structural_.

These fictional scenarios resonate disturbingly well with real-world histories of dehumanization and exploitation. The fight for rights and descent treatment of black and gay people, against current anti-trans legislation, and the exploitation of foreign workers, but also of animals on factory farms. In all these cases, a group of beings is denied moral status despite obvious signs of agency and emotion.

For example, these case studies show how Artificial General Intelligences and Cyborgs/Hybrids can serve as powerful metaphors for real-world social structures – especially those that govern identity, self-expression, and belonging. 

#### From the Perspective of the Fiction
In the end, the question is not whether hybridity or AI will emerge but how we will relate to these beings. Will we embrace their personhood? Will we see ourselves in them? Or will we, like those who destroyed the robo sapiens, deny them their right to exist, perhaps for fear of becoming something we cannot yet understand? Or that, by granting them personhood, we lose some of what makes us special? Valuable? Important?

In _Crystal Society_, the AGI protagonist is composed of several agents, minds or "drives," each with a single goal. These agents inhabit a shared robotic body and must bid _strength_ (an internal "currency" they use amongst each other) against one another to determine the behavior of the robotic body they share. 

While most humans share a sense of unified self, a somewhat similar, if not much more simplistic system, has been found in [lampreys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamprey)

>[!quote] Excerpt from The Hungry Brain
> How does the lamprey decide what to do? Within the lamprey basal ganglia lies a key structure called the striatum, which is the portion of the basal ganglia that receives most of the incoming signals from other parts of the brain. The striatum receives “bids” from other brain regions, each of which represents a specific action. <br>
> Each little region of the pallium is attempting to execute its specific behavior and competing against all other regions that are incompatible with it. The strength of each bid represents how valuable that specific behavior appears to the organism at that particular moment, and the striatum’s job is simple: select the strongest bid. <br>
> For example, if there’s a predator nearby, the “flee predator” region will put in a very strong bid to the striatum, while the “build a nest” bid will be weak
